# Howto compile HexGame on Android using CMake

## Dependenceis

In order to successfully build HexGame on Android you will need the
following:

* Android SDK rev 11 or later [http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html]

* Android NDK r5c or later [http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html]

* android-cmake [http://code.google.com/p/android-cmake/]


## Preparations

Before building, you need to set up your environment so that CMake can
find the necessary tools, include files and libraries in the Android NDK
and android-cmake.

### Step 1 - Creating an Android NDK Toolchain

For this step, please read the guide on setting up your own Android NDK
toolchain found in ${NDK}/docs/STANDALONE-TOOLCHAIN.html

HexGame requires ABI-level 9 or later.

### Step 2 - Setting up your environment

In order to build with android-cmake you need to explain where your NDK
and your standalone toolchain can be found. It is recommended that you
add the following lines to your ~/.profile so that you don't have to
worry about them further on. Modify the paths below to point at the
respective installations on your system

export ANDROID_DEV_ROOT=/path/to/base/directory
export ANDROID_SDK=${ANDROID_DEV_ROOT}/android-sdk-mac_86
export ANDROID_NDK_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT=${ANDROID_DEV_ROOT}/android-toolchain-9
export ANDTOOLCHAIN=${ANDROID_DEV_ROOT}/android-cmake/toolchain/android.toolchain.cmake
export SYSROOT=${ANDROID_NDK_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT}/sysroot

export PATH=$ANDROID_NDK_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT/bin:$ANDROID_SDK/tools:$ANDROID_SDK/platform-tools:$PATH

alias androidcmake='cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${ANDTOOLCHAIN} '


## Building HexGame

1.  Create an out-of-source build directory and change to this
directory, e.g.: mkdir build-android cd build-android

2.  Run the alias androidcmake with the required cmake flags:

androidcmake ../ -DTARGET_PLATFORM=Android -DLIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH_ROOT=./apk

NOTE! If building this on Mac OS X, you will need to tell CMake where to
find install_name_tool by adding the following flag to the line above:

* On Mac OS X 10.5 - 10.6 (Leopard and Snow Leopard):
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_TOOL=/usr/bin/install_name_tool

* On Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion):
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_TOOL=/Developer/usr/bin/install_name_tool

3.  The build above will fail because CMake is unable to compile and
copy a sample file. This is Ok, it will be resolved by re-running CMake:

cmake .

4.  Now CMake successfully configured our project, time to build:

make

5.  Congratulations, by now you should have successfully built HexGame
and created an .apk-file that you can install on your device by running:

cd apk
ant install

6. Run the game on your device by selecting HexGame in the App List.
