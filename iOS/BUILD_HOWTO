# Howto compile HexGame on iOS using CMake

## Dependenceis

In order to successfully build HexGame on iOS you will need the
following:

* python-for-iphone [https://github.com/cobbal/python-for-iphone/]

## Preparations

Before building, you need to set up your environment so that CMake can
find the necessary tools, include files and libraries.

1. Clone our repository of python-for-iphone somewhere outside HexGame:
git clone https://mickeprag@github.com/mickeprag/python-for-iphone.git
cd python-for-iphone

2. Build it:
./iOS-build.sh

## Building HexGame

1.  Create an out-of-source build directory and change to this
directory, e.g.: mkdir build-ios cd build-ios

2.  Run cmake with the required cmake flags:

cmake .. -G Xcode -DTARGET_PLATFORM=iOS -DPYTHON_FOR_IOS_DIR=<path-to-python-for-iphone>/Python-2.6.5/_install

Change <path-to-python-for-iphone> for the actual path to python for iphone.

NOTE! If building this on Mac OS X, you will need to tell CMake where to
find install_name_tool by adding the following flag to the line above:

* On Mac OS X 10.5 - 10.6 (Leopard and Snow Leopard):
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_TOOL=/usr/bin/install_name_tool

* On Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion):
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_TOOL=/Developer/usr/bin/install_name_tool

4.  Now CMake successfully configured our project, open the created project in Xcode:
